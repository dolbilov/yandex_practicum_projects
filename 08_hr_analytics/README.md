# HR analytics 👨‍💻

## Data
Several datasets were given with various information about employees: workload level, salary, supervisor assessment, and so on

## Task

There are 2 tasks to be solved within the project:
The first is to build a model that can predict employee satisfaction based on customer data. 
Why this is important for business: job satisfaction directly affects the outflow of employees. And predicting churn is one of the most important tasks of HR analysts. Sudden layoffs carry risks for the company, especially if an important employee leaves.

Your second task is to build a model that can predict based on customer data that an employee will leave the company.
