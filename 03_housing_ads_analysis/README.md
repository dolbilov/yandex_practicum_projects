# Housing Ads Analysis üè†

## Data

The dataset contains information about real estate sales in St. Petersburg and its surroundings.

The dataset contains various data that can be divided into 3 categories:

1) Information about the property itself: floor, number of rooms, area of the entire apartment, kitchen area, living area and number of floors in the house.
2) Data on the location of the property: in which locality is located, how far from the center, how many ponds and parks are nearby, the distance to the nearest airport and the city center.
3) Information about the ad: the date of placement, price, how many days have passed from the moment of publication to the sale.

## Task

It was necessary to analyze and pre-process the dataset: fill in the gaps, deal with outliers.

After that, it was necessary to add new columns and answer questions about the impact of various factors on the sale price of real estate.
